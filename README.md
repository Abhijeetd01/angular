# Up and Running with Angular.js
This is a finished version of my [Up and Running with Angular.js](http://www.lynda.com/AngularJS-tutorials/Up-Running-AngularJS/154414-2.html) course on [Lynda.com](http://lynda.com). I added a gulp.js file so that it will run a live reload server.

This version also uses FireBase instead of a JSON file. I'm including another branch called original with the original code from the course.

##Instructions

1. Make sure you have node.js and git installed on your machine.
2. Clone this into your local machine using the terminal (mac) or Gitbash (PC)
3. Run `> npm-install` to install the project dependencies
4. Remember, this example doesn't include the images folder or the images from the course. For those you have to be a premium member of lynda.com and have access to the exercise files. Use your own images or replace the images with a site like [PlaceHold.it](http://placehold.it/)
