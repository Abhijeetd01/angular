# Introductory Statement
JavaScript Functions is not a beginner course, and I'm starting with the assumption that there's a few things you already know before taking this course.

## Basic HTML
You should be familiar building online projects and know how HTML works. A really good course to check out is James Williamson's[HTML5: Structure, Syntax, and Semantics][1]. 

## Basic JavaScript
You should also be familiar with basic JavaScript concepts, if you need help, check out Simon Allardice's [JavaScript Essential Training][2].

## Text Editors
You should be comfortable editing with Text Editors like BBEdit, Sublime Text or others. In this course, I'm going to use an editor called Sublime Text, but you should use your favorite text editor.

# Conclusion
JavaScript Events is not for beginners, but with some background experience with JavaScript, you should have no problem taking this course.
