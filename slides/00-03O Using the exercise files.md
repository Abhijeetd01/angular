# Introductory Statement
If you are a premium member of lynda.com, you have access to the exercise files used throughout this title.

## Explanation of Exercise Files

In the Exercise Files folder, you'll find folders for each video in the series. Inside those folders, you should see a finished folder as well as a working folder.

The working folder has a copy of the project when I start one of the videos, the finished folder has a copy of the project at the end.

I'll start each movie with the folder inside the working folder on the desktop and that folder already opened inside my text editor.


# Conclusion
If you are a monthly member or annual member of lynda.com, you donâ€™t have access to the exercise files, but you can follow along from scratch with your own assets.

**So let's get ready to get busy with JavaScript functions.**
