Advanced Filters

> > Author Notes:
In the last video, we looked at the text transformation filters. Interesting, but not super useful...There's a different group of filters that allow you to work with lists and we can use that to search through our list for a series of elements.

## Array Filters

- `limitTo`
- `filter`
- `orderBy`</div>
</div>

> > Author Notes:
- The first filter we'll look at is called limitTo and it creates a new array or string by showing you only a certain number o felements from an array. you can control wether it starts from the beginning or the end of the list and what position to start from.

- Although it's a bit confusing, one of the filters is called 'filter' It selects a subset of items from an array and makes a new array from it. We can use it to do a live search of our data.

- The last filter is called OrderBy and it lets you  you to re-order an array based on a key in ascending or descending order.


## Conclusion
Together these filters let you create a really nice search application.If you want to learn more about these simple filters, make sure you check the documentation at this URL. https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter
