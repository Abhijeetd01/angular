What is AngularJS?

> > Author Notes:
- Angular JS is simply a framework That makes it easier to build single page and web applications.
- A framework is simply a way to structure your programs so if write code using the framework, it makes it easier to build complex functionality.

## Features

- Directives
- MVC
- Data binding
- Expressions

> > Author Notes:
- One way that AngularJS makes this possible is by the use of directives, or commands that you can add to HTML to give it superpowers.
- AngularJS uses a Model, View Controller structure for it's framework. When we talk about the model, we simply mean the data, the view means a template system that helps us add angular code into our HTML pages, finally the controller is the name for the javascript that links the data to the templates. Although AngularJS structure can be configured in alternative ways, it's this MVC structure that is the most common.
- Another interesting features is the ability to bind the model and views together. This is called data binding and AngularJS has a unique way of doing this called two-way data binding. That means that if something in the template can cause the value of a variable to change and that something in the scripts can also cause something in the template to change. They are both tied or bound together.
- AngularJS uses double curly braces to create expressions. Expressions is how you output something from the controller...or the javascript into the HTML view or template.

## AngularJs vs Angular

- Different paradigm
- MVC vs components
- More stable
- Less tooling

> > Author Notes:
AngularJS is technically the old version of the framework so you might be wondering why anyone would want to use an older version of a framework..
- The main reason is that the new version of Angular, which is called just Angular instead of AngularJS is a complete re-write of the framework, so learning Angular is like learning a completely different framework.
- Instead of using the model view component architecture, it uses a component based architecture, which is an approach that a lot of more modern frameworks use.
- One reason to stay with the first version of angular is that it is pretty stable. The new version of Angular is currently on a schedule that updates to a major version every six months. That can be really disruptive if you've got a lot of code to maintain and you don't have time to do major revisions of your code very often.
- Also, the new version of Angular requires a lot of tooling in order to work, so it takes longer to set up. With the older version of angular, all you have to do is load up script tags into your HTML, so it's as easy as installing something like jQuery or Bootstrap.
