Hi there, My name is Ray Villalobos and in this short, project based course we're going to take a look at AngularJS, the original version 1 of the amazing front end developer framework.

I'll start by discussing what AngularJS is and how it can help you build applications faster and more efficiently.

I'll show you how to divide your project into different modules and how to work with Angular services like http and routeProvider

I'll also cover some advanced features of the framework like deep linking, working with routes and templates

We're going to do this by creating a directory search application, a traditional project that you might add to one of your existing websites.

There's a lot to learn, but that's why you're here, so let's get started.
