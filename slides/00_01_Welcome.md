Hi there, My name is Ray Villalobos and I'm a Staff Author at Lynda.com

I'm really excited to talk to you about this short, project based Up and Running with Angular.js course.

One of the problems with learning Angular.js is that there's a lot of Jargon and confusing terminology associated with the framework. My goal with this course is to cut through the terminology and show you how to work with Angular through a realistic project.

I'll start by discussing what the Angular.js framework is and how it can help you build single web applications faster and more efficiently.

I'll talk about the MVC architecture that typically forms the foundation of AngularJS projects. Models, which are nothing more than your data, views, which is how that data is flowed into a template and a controller, which is the JavaScript that links the two together.

I'll show you how to divide your project into different modules and how to work with Angular services like http, routeProvider and animation.

I'll also show you some advanced features of the framework like deep linking, creating routes and working with different plug-in modules like animation.

We're going to do all this by creating a directory search application, a traditional project that you might add to one of your existing websites.

My goal is not just to show you how to work with the framework, but to cut through the jargon and help you understand how to get things done with Angular.js.

There's a lot to learn, but that's why you're here, so let's get started with Up and Running with Angular.js
