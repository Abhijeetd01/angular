Once again, this is Ray Villalobos, thanks for watching this course. We have a lot of great angular content an if you've enjoyed this course, you should check out AngularJS: Form Validation, it talks about one of the cool features of angularJS that makes it easier to validate forms.

Next, I'd recommend looking at this course on Adding Registration to your applications. It shows you how to use a fantastic noSQL database from Google called Firebase.

You may also want to take a peek at this course on Building a Data Driven App, it's a continuation of the registration course that shows you how to build an App with AngularJS.

Finally, if you want to take a peek at the next version of Angular, take a look at this course, where you build the same application on the course you just take, with the new version of the framework.

If you want to learn more about me, you can reach me at my personal site raybo.org or through twitter, github, LinkedIn or about any other social media network @planetoftheweb.
